        Bridges and roads! Six players compete on a medium-sized 128x128 map.
        The teams consist of the three northwest players versus the three
        southeast players. Each player's base features narrow bridges to two
        rear expansions and one forward expansion. However, the two rear
        expansions also feature wide bridges to neighboring players' expansions,
        which provide additional pathways to attack your opponents from the
        rear! Neutral structures must be destroyed to cross these rear bridges.
        Each player's forward expansion also features a wide bridge to the
        central roadway, which acts as a hub to each player's forward expansion.
        In each team of three, the two players on the flanks will need to
        carefully guard all pathways to their bases.
