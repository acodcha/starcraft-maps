This repository contains my custom-made maps for the StarCraft Brood War and StarCraft Remastered video games by Blizzard Entertainment. Maps used in professional leagues are typically designed for 1vs1 and 2vs2 games, whereas my maps focus on 3vs3 and 4vs4 games.

To play a map, simply download its `.scx` file and place it anywhere in your StarCraft maps directory, which is typically `C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft\Maps\`. When creating a game, select the `Use Map Settings` option; otherwise, player starting locations may be randomized rather than team-based.

## Intertwined Platforms (2vs2)

![Intertwined_Platforms](maps/Intertwined_Platforms/Intertwined_Platforms.png?)

Four players are squeezed onto a tiny map! The teams consist of the north and east players versus the south and west players. Each player's base features a protected expansion. Neutral structures must be destroyed to gain access to the central platform. The distance to your opponents' bases is very short, so be prepared for quick aggression!

Compatible with either StarCraft Brood War or StarCraft Remastered.

## Beltway Blitz (3vs3)

![Beltway_Blitz](maps/Beltway_Blitz/Beltway_Blitz.png?)

Six players are squeezed onto a tiny map! The teams consist of the three west players versus the three east players. Each team features a large base shared by its three players. Each shared base contains three expansions; one for each player, though some expansions are more exposed than others! Two bridges link your team's base to the opposing team's base, though neutral structures must be destroyed to cross the bridges.

Compatible with either StarCraft Brood War or StarCraft Remastered.

## Frigid Basin (3vs3)

![Frigid_Basin](maps/Frigid_Basin/Frigid_Basin.png?)

Six players compete on a standard-size map. The teams consist of the three northeast players versus the three southwest players. Each player has their own base on high ground and access to a natural expansion on the low ground in front of their base. Additional expansions ring the map between the players' bases; though these expansions may appear sheltered, expansions that lie between enemy players are difficult to hold. A final set of expansions dot the high ground cliffs around the central basin; these expansions are the most exposed, but holding their high ground confers a significant positional advantage.

Compatible with StarCraft Remastered only. Not compatible with StarCraft Brood War.

## Magmatic Delve (3vs3)

![Magmatic_Delve](maps/Magmatic_Delve/Magmatic_Delve.png?)

Shared bases! Six players compete on a standard-size map. The teams consist of the three northeast players versus the three southwest players. Each team features a large high-ground base shared by its three players. The shared bases feature sheltered rear expansions along with more exposed forward expansions on lower ground. There are additional expansions in the northwest and southeast corners; these are reasonably sheltered though faraway and equidistant to both teams. Finally, there are additional expansions on the high grounds northwest and southeast of the central flats; these expansions are the most exposed, but confer a good defensive position. Control of the vast open central flats is key!

Compatible with StarCraft Remastered only. Not compatible with StarCraft Brood War.

## Motley Turnpike (3vs3)

![Motley_Turnpike](maps/Motley_Turnpike/Motley_Turnpike.png?)

Bridges and roads! Six players compete on a standard-size map. The teams consist of the three northwest players versus the three southeast players. Each player's base features narrow bridges to two rear expansions and one forward expansion. However, the two rear expansions also feature wide bridges to neighboring players' expansions, which provide additional pathways to attack your opponents from the rear! Neutral structures must be destroyed to cross these rear bridges. Each player's forward expansion also features a wide bridge to the central roadway, which acts as a hub to each player's forward expansion. In each team of three, the two players on the flanks will need to carefully guard all pathways to their bases.

Compatible with either StarCraft Brood War or StarCraft Remastered.

## Azurean Reliquary (4vs4)

![Azurean_Reliquary](maps/Azurean_Reliquary/Azurean_Reliquary.png?)

Shared bases! Eight players compete on a standard-size map. The teams consist of the four southwest players versus the four northeast players. Each team features a large high-ground base shared by its four players. Each shared base features sheltered rear expansions along with more exposed forward expansions on lower ground. Additional expansions line the edges of the central reliquary. The reliquary is on high ground, so controlling it is key.

## Isthmus Scramble (4vs4)

Eight players are squeezed onto a tiny map! The teams consist of the four northeast players versus the four southwest players. Each team features a large base shared by its four players. Each shared base contains only two expansions. Your team's base is linked to the opposing team's base via one wide bridge and two narrow bridges, though neutral structures must be destroyed to cross the bridges.

## Luxuriant Sanctuary (4vs4)

![Luxuriant_Sanctuary](maps/Luxuriant_Sanctuary/Luxuriant_Sanctuary.png?)

Eight players compete on a standard-size map. The teams consist of the four north players versus the four south players. Each player has their own base on high ground and access to a natural expansion on the low ground in front of their base. Additional expansions ring the map between the players' bases; though these expansions may appear sheltered, expansions that lie between enemy players are difficult to hold. A final set of expansions are scattered throughout the central sanctuary; these expansions are the most exposed, but holding the central sanctuary is strategically important as it acts as a hub to all other expansions.

Shared bases! Eight players compete on a standard-size map. The teams consist of the four northwest players versus the four southeast players. Each team features a large base shared by its four players. Each shared base features a set of sheltered rear expansions along with two sets of more exposed forward expansions.

Each player has their own base on high ground and access to a protected rear expansion and a more exposed forward expansion on low ground. Additional sheltered expansions ring the map to the far north, far south, far east, and far west. The central valley is littered with tar pits and features a final set of four expansions, which are very exposed and difficult to hold.
