This repository contains my custom-made maps for the StarCraft Remastered video game by Blizzard Entertainment. Maps used in professional leagues are typically designed for 1vs1 games, whereas my maps focus on 2vs2, 3vs3, and 4vs4 team games.

To play a map, simply download its .scx file and place it anywhere in your StarCraft maps directory, which is typically: `C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft\Maps\`

Standard Maps:

- [Intertwined Platforms (2vs2)](#intertwined-platforms-2vs2)
- [Isthmus Scramble (4vs4)](#isthmus-scramble-4vs4)
- [Luxuriant Sanctuary (4vs4)](#luxuriant-sanctuary-4vs4)
- [Stratal Concourse (4vs4)](#stratal-concourse-4vs4)

Scenario Maps:

- [Terran Obstacle Course](#terran-obstacle-course)
- [Zerg Obstacle Course](#zerg-obstacle-course)
