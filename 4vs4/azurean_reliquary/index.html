        Shared bases! Eight players compete on a medium-sized 128x128 map. The
        teams consist of the four southwest players versus the four northeast
        players. Each team features a large high-ground base shared by its four
        players. Each shared base features sheltered rear expansions along with
        more exposed forward expansions on lower ground. Additional expansions
        line the edges of the central reliquary. The reliquary is on high
        ground, so controlling it is key.
